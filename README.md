* Automatic self-healing in the event of split brain, new nodes being added to the cluster, and more.
* Expired sessions automatically deleted accordingly

## Include the dependency

Add as a rebar dependency in your rebar.config

```erlang
{deps, [canister]}.
```

## Start It

Put it in your `app.src` file or start it explicitly with:

```
application:ensure_all_started(canister).
```

## Functionality

### Save a Session Variable

canister:put(SessionID, Key, Value).
```

```erlang
canister:get(SessionID, Key).
```

See [canister.config](https://github.com/nitrogen/canister/blob/master/src/canister_config.erl) for explanation of configuration variables.
